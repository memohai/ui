         divider, so the row above it loses its :last-child border-b-0 escape
         and would stack its own hairline against the footer's — two lines
         fighting. The nth-last-child(3) rule hands the "I'm last" treatment to
         whatever content element sits directly above the footer's hairline. -->

           Lives INSIDE the card, after the rows. Its divider is an INSET
           hairline — same inset logic as a row divider, aligned to the content
           padding rather than touching the card's edges. Only rendered when a
           caller fills it, so a plain section is untouched. -->
